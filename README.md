# Snow Today Webapp Server

Serve data supporting the [Snow Today
Webapp](https://github.com/nsidc/snow-today-webapp). This data is version-controlled in
this repository, with the exception of Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs and plot data, which are
populated dynamically on a daily basis.

* Static data:
  * Index of available variables
  * Index of available regions and subregions (generated by
    `scripts/make_region_shape_geojson.py`, but not expected to change)
  * Shapes (GeoJSON) of each region
* Dynamic data (expected to be mounted as Docker volumes):
  * Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs for each variable (populated dynamically by
    `scripts/make_cogs.sh`)
  * Plot data JSON (populated dynamically by `scripts/make_plot_json.py`)
