# Snow Today Webapp Server

Generate and serve data supporting the [Snow Today
Webapp](https://github.com/nsidc/snow-today-webapp).

Static data is version-controlled in this repository. Daily dynamic data (e.g.
Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs) are generated by executing code in this repository.

[More on data served by Snow Today Webapp Server](doc/data.md)

NOTE: Because there is a co-dependency between the dynamic data-generation code and the
static configuration code, they are intentionally versioned together in this repository.
